# Pump-It-Up
Leverage machine learning and classification algorithms to predict the operational status of water pumps in Tanzania, categorizing them as functional, non-functional, or in need of repair.

This model was developed as a part of the "Pump It Up" competition, on DrivenData. The final results of running this ensemble model (using Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost), will be an excel sheet that can be submitted into the competition.
